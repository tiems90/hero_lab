  <thing id="OddSir" name="Siren" description="Sirens are a race of winged, aquatic humanoids that typi- cally dwell near rocky sea cliffs. They are famed for their beautiful voices, which they use to sing haunting lamen- tations, captivating listeners and transporting them to a bygone age. Sirens are rarely found very far inland. They prefer to remain near the coasts, as the gentle roar of the ocean waves calms their roiling emotions.\n\nSirens typically experience fluctuating moods from one day to the next, ranging from extreme joy and hope for the future, to extreme sorrow and pessimism. No matter how a siren feels, she expresses her emotion through song. On good days, she may annoy her com- panions with chirpy melodies and vocal warm-ups as she glides around on outstretched wings. Bad days, on the other hand, may see her moaning and wailing and dragging her feet." compset="Race" summary="Sirens are a race of winged, aquatic humanoids that typically dwell near rocky sea cliffs.">

There are many kinds of nymphs—dryads of the forests, naiads of the rivers, oreads of the mountains, aurae of the night sky, and nereids of the sea. They have walked the earth for millennia, ever since the Great Mother awakened them from the trees, waters, rocks, and breezes.\nNymphs are most at home in nature, but they have been known to disguise themselves and live amongst mortals, for they are desperately curious about the civilized world. In spite of this, they often have a difficult time comprehending the day-to-day struggle of civilized existence. Their charms are such that they may inadvert- ently seduce and domesticate mortal ‘pets’ who see to their every need, leaving them somewhat puzzled by the ugliness and hardship that seems to pervade cities." compset="Race" summary="Nymphs are fey spirits that manifest from the beauty of the elemental forces of creation.">

Odysseans are often drawn into conflicts that take them far from home, where monsters and other dangers are a constant threat. Such harrowing odysseys are the namesake of the Odyssean, who may be forced to survive several such journeys in their lifetime.\n\nAs an Odyssean rogue, you have a quick mind and you can intuit the strengths of your companions.
